Building:

Make sure you have the CROSS_COMPILE variable set to the toolchain prefix, in the
same way as when building a Linux kernel.

You have to use configure's --with-linux option to specify the path to the linux
tree.

In order to build the unit tests you also have to specify the --host parameter

Example:
	$ export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
	$ ./configure --host=arm-linux-gnueabihf --with-linux=/path/to/linux

# build the module
	$ make

# build the tests
	$ make check
