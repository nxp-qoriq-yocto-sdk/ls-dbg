Installation instructions

After the build process the module will be placed in ls-dbg/module/ls-dbg.ko and
the tests in test/test_ls_dbg. Both these files should be transferred to the 
board.

Then, on the board, run:

# insmod ls-dbg.ko

After this, the /dev/ls-dbg entry should be automatically created by udev.
If this doesn't happen you have to create it by hand.

# grep ls-dbg /proc/misc
 59 ls-dbg
# mknod /dev/ls-dbg c 10 59

To run the unit tests you have to make sure that the module is not loaded.
If necessary use "rmmod ls-dbg" to unload it. Then run:

# ./test_ls_dbg

Make sure that test_ls_dbg and ls-dbg.ko are in the same directory.
